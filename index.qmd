### About me
I studied Chemistry at ETH Zurich and completed my doctoral studies in the group of Prof. Christophe Coperet on understanding heterogeneous catalysts by combining synthetic, spectroscopic and computational methods. Afterwards I worked in the group of Prof. Erwin Reisner at the University of Cambridge UK, developing electro-​ and photocatalytic approaches for the valorization of waste chemicals. Since 2022, I joined Swiss CAT+ at ETH Zürich as a Scientist focusing on  chemical data analysis and management, and developing automated high-​throughput workflows in catalysis.
